# W-Vawe Radio

W-Vawe Radio is my first independent web development project. This project is a web page that demonstrates not only the basics of HTML and CSS but also advanced layout techniques.

## Overview

The W-Vawe Radio project showcases various web development skills, including:

- **Adaptive Layout**: The webpage is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Text/Block Overflow Handling**: The design ensures that text and blocks do not overflow their containers.
- **Pixel Perfect Design**: The layout is made with precision to match the design specifications.
- **BEM Classification**: The project follows the Block Element Modifier (BEM) methodology for naming CSS classes.
- **Accessibility**: The interface is accessible from the keyboard and is optimized for screen readers.

## Features

- Responsive design that works on different devices and screen sizes.
